I then meet my dad's friend's son, His name is Giovanni, he's a funny simple guy, not an intellectual, yet a person who you can have simple intense fun with.",

We've had quite the fun together, We did Omegle Chats (I'm the dude that looks like a masked weird guy), went to the pool, also did a party together the next day where I played the DJ.",
            "There were 4 of us, Giovanni, Tommaso, Alessandro and me.",

We were swimming and Alessandro (wich had snorkles) saw an interesting thing moving below a rock, we inspect, see a tentacle moving and Alessandro just happens to be so cuirous that he attempts four times before managing to catch it (almost deprahived from oxygen but still, mission accomplished).",

It turned out to be outrageously compicated, and also unrealistic. I was not enjoiying it to the fullest.",

I don't have photos of the game since they don't allow using your phone ingame, wich makes sense since it would not be a fair advantage.",
